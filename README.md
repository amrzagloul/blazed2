BlazeD2
=======

BlazeD2 is a D version 2 port of Blaze, a 2D game physics engine based on Box2D.
It's a direct port with no functional changes. Only the DSSS build system was replaced
by a Visual D project.

Original
========

The original Blaze can be found on dsource.org: 
http://www.dsource.org/projects/blaze

Limitations
===========

As examples and tests were based on Tango and team0xf's OMG, I did NOT port them.
Consequently the best showcasa for Blaze capabilities still is on the original dsource project page.

Alternatives
============

Blaze is lagging behind today's box2d. Check out Dchip instead:
